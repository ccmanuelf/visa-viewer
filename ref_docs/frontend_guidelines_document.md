# Frontend Guideline Document

This document provides an easy-to-understand guide for how the frontend of the VISA DECLARATION VIEWER application is built. It explains the architecture, design principles, styling, component structure, data management, routing, performance, and testing strategies in everyday language.

## 1. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using Vue.js which makes it easy to create components that neatly separate functionalities. We are also using a few important libraries and tools:

*   **Bulma**: For classic CSS styling with borders and an elegant, minimal design.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For extra styling and help with responsiveness.
*   **Tabulator.js**: For an interactive table that displays data fetched via API calls.

The overall structure is component-based, which means every piece of functionality (like each tab, the table, and the editable grid) is its own component. This kind of setup supports scalability (easy to add new features), maintainability (each component can be worked on separately), and performance (components can be loaded as needed).

## 2. Design Principles

We follow several simple, easy-to-follow design concepts:

*   **Usability**: The interface is designed so that every user, even if not technically inclined, can view and manage visa declaration data without confusion. Navigation is simple and actions like selecting a row trigger API calls smoothly.
*   **Accessibility**: We make sure the app is usable by everyone by following standard practices, like clear text, proper contrast, and easy-to-read layouts.
*   **Responsiveness**: The design works well on different devices from desktops to tablets and mobile phones. Using Tailwind CSS, we ensure that every screen adjusts nicely to different sizes.

These principles are reflected in every part of the application, from the tab navigation described in the sample_tab.html to the intuitive layouts of the data views.

## 3. Styling and Theming

### Styling Approach

We use two main CSS solutions:

*   **Bulma**: Offers a classic style with well-defined borders and structured formats.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Adds extra responsiveness and custom styling capabilities.

Both are integrated to provide a balance of quick styling tweaks and robust design systems.

### CSS Methodologies and Pre-processors

The project follows methodologies similar to BEM (Block Element Modifier) for clear class naming, ensuring that styles do not conflict.

### Theming

We aim for a consistent look and feel across the application. For example, the tabs refer to a design shown in sample_tab.html. We follow a clean, modern, and flat design approach with hints of material design where appropriate.

Color Palette

A sample color palette for the app might include:

*   Primary: #3498db (a calm blue)
*   Secondary: #2ecc71 (a soft green)
*   Accent: #e74c3c (a vibrant red)
*   Background: #f5f5f5 (a light gray)
*   Text: #333333 (dark gray for easy reading)

### Fonts

Depending on the style, a sans-serif font like 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans' is recommended for a modern and clean look. These fonts ensure that text is easy to read and maintains a professional feel.

## 4. Component Structure

Our application is broken down into small, reusable pieces called components. Here is how some of the main components are structured:

*   **Tab Components:** Each tab (Tab 1 for Tabulator Table, Tab 2 for Detailed Information, Tab 3 for Editable Grid, Tab 4 for Printable Labels) is a separate Vue component. This approach makes it easy to manage changes in one tab without affecting others.
*   **Table and Card Components:** The dynamic table and detailed records are kept in their own components. The table component handles data display using Tabulator.js, and the card component handles detailed views of the selected row.
*   **Editable Grid Component:** Contains logic for inline editing, drag-and-drop reordering, and temporary data management.

This component-based approach ensures that everything is modular, making it easier to update, test, and maintain.

## 5. State Management

We manage shared data between components using Vuex (or a similar state management pattern) which makes sure that data flows correctly across the application. Here’s how it works:

*   **Central Data Store:** All the important data, like the data fetched from the API and any temporary changes in the editable grid, are stored in a centralized place.
*   **Consistent Updates:** When a user selects a row in the Tabulator table, the data for the rest of the application is updated seamlessly via Vuex. This helps with real-time synchronization of information across tabs.
*   **Simplicity in Sharing:** Components subscribe to changes in this store so they can react accordingly. This makes the user experience smooth and consistent.

## 6. Routing and Navigation

Since the app uses a tab-based interface, navigation is built around tab selection:

*   **Tab Navigation:** The main navigation is based around visible tabs as outlined in the sample_tab.html. Users can easily switch between four key areas of the application: the data table, detailed view, editable grid, and printable labels.
*   **Routing Libraries:** While Vue Router might be used in scenarios where navigation extends beyond simple tabs, for this project the tab interface handles most navigation requirements.

This intuitive navigation ensures that standard users can easily switch between views without any technical barriers.

## 7. Performance Optimization

We have worked to make sure that our application runs as fast as possible using several approaches:

*   **Lazy Loading:** Components that are not needed immediately are loaded only when required. This helps with faster start-up times and smooth switching between tabs.
*   **Code Splitting:** We break code into smaller pieces, delivering only what is needed at any given time, which reduces load times.
*   **Asset Optimization:** Images, CSS, and JavaScript files are optimized and minified before deployment. This ensures that the app loads quickly even on slower networks.

These measures all work together to create a user experience that is both fast and responsive.

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

Quality is key for ensuring that the application works as expected. We employ a variety of testing methods:

*   **Unit Tests:** Each component is tested in isolation to ensure it works correctly on its own.
*   **Integration Tests:** We test how components work together — for example, ensuring that when a row is selected in the Tabulator table, all related data updates in the other tabs.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Real-world workflows are tested to make sure the entire application works as intended. This includes checking that API calls succeed, data displays correctly, and notifications are shown for successes or failures.

Along with these testing practices, industry tools and frameworks (like Jest for unit tests and Cypress for end-to-end testing) are used to achieve a reliable and robust codebase.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary

This document outlines the guidelines for creating and maintaining the frontend of the VISA DECLARATION VIEWER application. In summary:

*   We use a modern component-based architecture using Vue.js, supported by Bulma and Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.
*   The design principles ensure that the app is usable, accessible, and responsive on various devices.
*   Styling is consistent with a modern, flat, material-inspired look using a defined color palette and font choices.
*   A robust component structure and centralized state management (with Vuex) allow the app to scale and stay maintainable over time.
*   Navigation is simple with a tab-based system, and performance optimizations like lazy loading and code splitting make sure the app runs smoothly.
*   Finally, comprehensive testing approaches are in place to ensure that every part of the app works correctly and reliably.

This guideline is designed to ensure that anyone working with or reviewing the project can quickly understand the frontend setup, technology choices, and design decisions, making it easier to maintain and extend the application in the future.
