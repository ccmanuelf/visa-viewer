# VISA DECLARATION VIEWER App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

The VISA DECLARATION VIEWER application does not require complex onboarding or multiple user roles. When a new user accesses the application, they are directed to the landing page where the main title is clearly displayed as VISA DECLARATION VIEWER. Although the current design focuses on a single-user experience without special privileges, the app is capable of being integrated with standard sign-in systems if in the future there is a need for email login, social sign-in, or password recovery mechanisms. At the moment, users simply load the application page and begin interacting with its features. Whether it is a standalone page or part of a larger secure portal, the underlying design has been created to facilitate easy access with minimal friction.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After accessing the application page, the user is presented with the central interface featuring a series of clearly defined tabs. The centered layout and classic Bulma styling ensure that the title is prominent and the tabs are easy to distinguish. The navigation menu is styled with a bordered, classic look using references from sample_tab.html. The page acts as a consolidated dashboard where all four tabs are visible. The overall design emphasizes a seamless transition between the different sections of the application. The interface is simple and uncluttered, allowing users to focus on the information provided within the tabs without distraction.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The heart of the application lies within its tab-based arrangement. The first tab presents the user with a Tabulator table that automatically populates using data from an API call. On this tab the user sees a selectable listing with each row containing a tickbox that represents a selectable item. The design ensures that only one row is selected at a time in order to maintain clarity and prevent confusion. Once the user selects a row by ticking the box, the application initiates an API call to retrieve detailed data corresponding to that row. When this data is successfully pulled, the application automatically changes the view to the second tab.

The second tab is dedicated to displaying detailed information associated with the item selected in the first tab. The detailed data is rendered in a clearly formatted layout on a centered card that hosts an HTML table. This table follows a pre-defined logic for layout, incorporating aggregates, detailed info, and a timestamp that shows the download date if needed. A Download button is prominently placed so that users can export this table to an XLSX file. This flow ensures that after selecting a row, users can immediately view more detailed records and have the ability to export the details without additional steps.

The third tab is designed for data manipulation. Once the detailed data is displayed on the second tab, the same or linked data is loaded into an editable grid on the third tab. In this part of the application, users are allowed to modify cell contents, rearrange rows through drag-and-drop interactions, and add new rows if necessary. Although the data editing features do not yet connect to persistent storage, they are built to handle temporary data manipulation until a new row is selected in the first tab, at which point the grid is refreshed. This design approach ensures that users have a flexible environment for testing changes and interacting with the data without concerns for immediate permanent updates.

The fourth tab is focused on the printing and display of labels. This view collects information aggregated from the detailed view in the second tab and the modifications made in the third tab. The label layout follows preliminary formatting logic detailed in a separate document titled Packing_labels.md. The labels are shown in a print-ready format, and users can easily send them to a printer. This final tab rounds out the userâ€™s workflow by providing a means to convert on-screen data into tangible, hard-copy format without disrupting the seamless flow provided by the earlier tabs.

## Settings and Account Management

While the VISA DECLARATION VIEWER application is primarily a single-page, tab-driven interface geared toward data presentation and manipulation, there is room for future integration of settings and account management features. In later versions, settings may be added to allow users to adjust preferences like notification styles, table formats, or theme modifications that blend Bulma and Tailwind design cues. When such settings are adjusted, users would be returned to the central dashboard with their new preferences applied immediately. For the current version, however, the focus remains on the four interconnected tabs with future hooks available for any personal information settings or preference control that might be required by a broader user base.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Every stage of the VISA DECLARATION VIEWER application accounts for potential errors and alternate user paths. Should an API call fail when populating the Tabulator table in the first tab or when retrieving detailed data for the second tab, industry best practices have been applied to present non-intrusive error messages or visual cues. If a user inputs invalid data or if the data fails to load, subtle notifications appear to alert them while not disrupting the overall layout of the page. In the editable grid of the third tab, any missteps in data entry prompt inline validation cues to guide the user. The design includes fallback states that ensure users can regain control of the data flow and proceed to the next action with clear, non-modal notification messages that do not disorient the user or break the seamless tab transitions.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The VISA DECLARATION VIEWER application is designed to deliver a streamlined user experience from the moment the user lands on the page. After accessing the application, users are gently guided through a logical flow that starts with a selectable table in the first tab. A selection triggers the automatic display of detailed data in the second tab, along with the option to download this formatted information. Users then have an opportunity to interact with and temporarily edit linked data within the third tab. Finally, the application ties together all data by generating print-ready labels in the fourth tab. Throughout this journey, clear design elements, seamless tab transitions, non-intrusive notifications, and robust error handling ensure that users never lose track of their progress. The VISA DECLARATION VIEWER offers a comprehensive yet simple interface optimized for the everyday use of standard users, ensuring that all key features and data flows are connected with clarity and efficiency.
